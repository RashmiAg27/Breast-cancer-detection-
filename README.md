This project aims to build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify breast MRI images as benign or malignant. Using a labeled MRI dataset, the model learns to detect cancerous patterns automatically. It involves image preprocessing, CNN-based feature extraction, and binary classification.
